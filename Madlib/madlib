The year is {year}, the world is in a state of turmoil as conflict between the nation of {animal}s and the United {food} Forces reaches its peak.
In a small village in the southern province of {dining} a child is born.
Unknown to the world, this child would be the one to rise up and bring peace to the troubled land.

From the age of {age}, {name} had practiced the hidden martial art of {gender2} family, Way of the {spcatt}.
Every day, {gender} spent {hours} hours {practice}.

Finally, after {age2} years, it was time to rise up and faces the leaders of the warring forces.

INTERLUDE
Hello, it's the narrator here.
The story is pretty {adj2}, right?
Maybe we should turn it into a {media}...anyway, back to the story.

First, {name} confronted the {leader1} of the {animal} nation.
Rather than stopping him by force, {gender} was able to win him over with a gift of {x}.

When {gender} tried the same tactic on the {leader2} of the United {food} Forces however, he grew incredibly furious.
What do you think I am, a {item}? You think I am so easily won over!?
No, we will settle this like {animal2}s, at the {place}!
I'm sorry, {name} said, but I must finish this here and now. You shall feel the fury of my {spcatt}!
With that, she began her attack.

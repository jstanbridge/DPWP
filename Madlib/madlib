The year is {year}, the world is in a state of turmoil as conflict between the nation of {animal}s and the United {food} Forces reaches its peak.
In a small village in the southern province of {dining} a child is born.
Unknown to the world, this child would be the one to rise up and bring peace to the troubled land.

From the age of {age}, {name} had practiced the hidden martial art of {gender2} family, Way of the {spcatt}.
Every day, {gender} spent {hours} hours {practice}.

Finally, after {age2} years, it was time to rise up and face the leaders of the warring forces.

INTERLUDE
Hello, it's the narrator here.
The story is pretty {adj2}, right?
Maybe we should turn it into a {media}...anyway, back to the story.

First, {name} confronted the {leader1} of the {animal} nation.
Rather than stopping him by force, {gender} was able to win him over with a gift of a {x}.

When {gender} tried the same tactic on the {leader2} of the United {food} Forces however, the {leader2} grew incredibly furious.
What do you think I am, a {item}? You think I am so easily won over!?
No, we will settle this like {animal2}s, at the {place}!
I'm sorry, {name} said, but I must finish this here and now. You shall feel the fury of my {spcatt}!
With that, {gender} began her attack.

A flurry of blows slammed into the {leader2}, knocking him to the floor. He lay there, unmoving. It was done.

Several months later, the two groups had put aside their differences and joined together to rebuild their nations as one.
{name} was now the {leader1} {leader2} of the United {food} {animal} nation.
As gratitude and tribute for {gender2} good deeds, the people of the new nation showered {gender3} with many gifts.
Among those, the gifts of a {prizes[0]}, {prizes[1]}, {prizes[2]}, and {prizes[3]} were treasured the most.
Everyone lived happily ever after.
